Ruby/Rails/Web Dev

[@lgarvey](https://twitter.com/lgarvey)

???

I'm a web developer from Sydney. I've been working with Ruby on Rails for 4-5 years now and worked with PHP, .NET, Java, Perl and a few
other languages before that. I'm here to help introduce you to Ruby on Rails. At the end I'm happy to answer any questions you might have
on Ruby, Rails, Web or development in general.

---

class: reinteractive, center, middle

![logo1](reinteractive-logo1.jpg)
![logo2](reinteractive-logo2.png)

We build custom online applications primarily with Ruby on Rails.

???

I'm here today because my company reInteractive lets me have 20% time to work on stuff like this. We also run a few community
events targetted towards people learning to program in Ruby which I'll get to later.

```ruby
class Ruby
  def what?
    "Ruby is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language"
  end

  def driving_principle
    "Ruby is designed for *programmer* happiness"
  end

  def why?
    ["Useful like Perl",
    "With proper OO",
    "Good functional support"].join(" ")
  end

  def who?
    "Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan ~20 years ago"
  end
end
```

???

Ruby is a multi-paradigm, dynamically typed interpreted programming language created in Japan around 20 years ago.
The goal of Ruby is to be as useful as Perl but have proper Object-oriented support like Smalltalk. It supports
functional concepts like lambda and closures making it easy to program in a functional or imperative style.

Like Python or Perl, Ruby can be used as a scripting language and excels at this task.

I enjoy using Ruby because it's beautiful, clean and easy to understand. When written well it almost reads as
English which I feel improves readability and therefore maintability significantly. The ruby community has
a large commitment to testing tools and has been widely influential in this area.

# Rails

## A whirlwind tour:
* Web framework built using Ruby
* Opinionated - convention over configuration
* Emphasis on automated-testing
* Consistent directory structure
* Model View Controller architecture
* Currently at version 4.1

???

We're going to cover lots and concepts here but Rails is featureful, opinionated providing lots of defaults
which make your life easier and make your web-app more secure.

# A web request in Rails

A http client issues a request to the server:

![chrome-logo](chrome-logo.png)
![rails](rails.png)
<p id="request1" class="request">GET /posts<p>

???

Like all web frameworks Rails starts with the request from the client. The client is probably
a browser but could be another program or a utility like curl.

The important parts here are the HTTP verb "GET", and the path "/posts".

---

class: centered-title

# A web request in Rails

Rails handles the request, using the router to send the request to the correct controller and action.
The router is in `config/routes.rb`

<div class="routing-request">
<p id="rails-router" class="rails-component">Router</p>
<p id="request2" class="request">GET /posts<p>
<p id="controller1" class="rails-component">PostsController</p>
<p id="controller2" class="rails-component">CommentsController</p>
<p id="controller3" class="rails-component">HomeController</p>
</div>

To learn more about Rails routing check out the [Routing guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html).

---

class: centered-title

# A web request in Rails

The controller action receives the request, gathers together information from the database and renders the response
which is sent back to the client.

<div class="routing-request">
<p id="controller-action-ball">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="controller4" class="rails-component">PostsController</p>
<p id="models" class="rails-component">Models</p>
<p id="view" class="rails-component">View</p>
<img src="chrome-logo.png" class="chrome-response"/>
</div>

# Controllers

Controllers are the "C" in MVC and live in `app/controllers`. By convention they are named as a pluralised
version of whatever "resource" (database model) it deals with. So if you controller handles the `Post` model
it will be called `PostsController` and be in the file `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
end
```

When you create a new Rails application it creates an `ApplicationController` which is used for common behaviour
between your separate controllers.


---

class: centered-title lightslide

# Controllers

Actions in a controller are the methods that deal with specific web-requests for that controllers resource.
By convention there are seven resourceful actions: `#index`, `#new`, `#create`, `#show`, `#edit`, `#update` and `#destroy`

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end

  def new
  end

  def create
  end

  def show
  end

  def edit
  end

  def update
  end

  def destroy
  end
end
```

---

class: centered-title colorfulslide

# Models and ActiveRecord

Rails uses an ORM called ActiveRecord as a database abstraction layer. This means you use your models to interact with
your database. Models live in `app/models`.

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

When Rails boots it reads the database structure and creates the attributes on this model depending on what
is in the database.

```ruby
p = Post.find(1) # find the post with an id of 1
p.id             #=> 1
p.title          #=> "Test title"
```

The code in your model can be focused on validations, or model specific business logic.

---

class: centered-title colorfulslide

# Programming Models

Models are used to contain business logic which is related to that particular model. Validations are a good example.
If you have a requirement that each Post must have a body field filled out then you would write this:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :body
end
```

This can mirror a database-constraint, but it can also do different things. For example you might want to specify
the format of an email address:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :email
  validates_format_of :email, with: /@/ # email must have a @ symbol in it.
end
```

---

class: centered-title alsocolorfulslide

# Views

Views are your application templates used to, primarly, generate HTML. They live in `app/views`.
Rails expects your views to be in a certain location depending on the controller action being executed.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  # The index view should be in `app/views/posts/index.html.erb`
  def index
  end

  # The new view should be in `app/views/posts/new.html.erb`
  def new
  end

  # By convention the create action does not have a view.
  # it will instead redirect on success or render the new view on failure.
  def create
  end
end
```

So the location of a view is: `<controller>/<action>` under the `app/views` directory.

---

class: centered-title alsocolorfulslide

# ERB

ERB is the templating "language" used for Rails. It stands for "Embedded Ruby".

Ruby code:
```ruby
<% ruby.code %>
```

Outputting the result of some ruby:
```ruby
<%= Post.find(1).body %>
```

So a simple html erb template might look like:

```html
<div class="posts">
  <% @posts.each do |post| %>
    <p><%= post.title %></p>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

# Assets

* CSS, JavaScript, Images are static assets and stores in `app/assets`
* SASS and CoffeeScript are supported by default
* The asset-pipeline concatenates and minifies your assets
* Also makes your application ready to integrate with a CDN

Read more about the assets at: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

???

In Rails static assets (images, javascript and css) are stored in `app/assets`. The appropriate directories
will be generated for you when you create your Rails application. Rails natively handles CSS-preprocessors like SASS
and the JavaScript-targetting CoffeeScript. Use of these is optional but personally recommended.

Rails has a technology called the "asset pipeline" which compiles SASS and CoffeeScript, concatenates and
minifies CSS and JavaScript so only 1 request is required from your HTML to load your CSS and JavaScript. The asset
pipeline also adds a "fingerprint" to your static assets which makes them *very* cache friendly. Integrating Rails
with a content delivery network (CDN) is very easy.


---

class: command-line

# Command Line Tools

Rails works with the command line:

To create a new Rails application:
```
rails new app_name
```

To start the Rails server:
```
rails server
```

To open an interactive application console:
```
rails console
```

To generate a new model:
```
rails generate model User email:string name:string birthdate:date
rake db:migrate
```

Most of these have shorter versions. `rails s` instead of `rails server`, `rails c` instead of `rails console`

???

Rails does not come with a complex IDE, instead of complex XML files it is just Ruby code comprising of your
application. This means it is easy to work with a simple text-editor and the command line.

class: heroku

# Deployment

Using a service like Heroku can make it extremely easy to deploy a Rails application for free on the internet.

1. Setup your Heroku account.
2. Use the heroku toolbelt to create your application.
3. Use git to push your application to the heroku servers.

Heroku has a really good guide on getting started: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4

???

Heroku can also web applications in a variety of other frameworks including Python, Django and Java.

# Getting Help with Rails

One of the best things about Ruby and Rails is the community. In Sydney there are three events which might
be interesting:

1. [Development Hub](http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/) - a hack night with mentors.
2. [Installfest](http://railsinstallfest.org) - free help to get your computer up and running with Rails.
3. [Ruby or Rails Oceania meetup](http://ruby.org.au/meetups/syd.html). A social event with talks.

Otherwise help can be found on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or on IRC in freenode `#rubyonrails`. Be careful about asking
other people to answer homework questions though, try to abstract your problem into something more
general.

If you tweet me [@lgarvey](https://twitter.com/lgarvey) with a gist explaining your problem and pointing towards your code (hopefully on github)
I might be able to help.

???

Essential Rails resources are:

1. The rails guides: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/
2. Rails documentation: http://api.rubyonrails.org/
3. Rails tutorial book: http://www.railstutorial.org/book

Some great Ruby resources are:

1. Learn to Program: https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/
2. Just enough Ruby: http://www.apeth.com/rubyIntro/justenoughruby.html
3. Ruby Koans: http://rubykoans.com/

# Assignment Comments

* For interacting with the APIs look to use a library rather than writing your own. There are ruby gems for Flickr,
Instagram, Google Maps and Twitter.
* Determine if you want to curate the collection of images, or live load the images from the API. I recommend curating
because it gives a consistent quality of outcome and can be more easily optimised for performance.
* You could curate images from the API by using a custom `rake` task or by building a curation interface which lets you choose and add "meta-data" to media pulled from the API according to your chosen theme.
* Start using a version control system like Git. This is industry standard and it will save your bacon. Share and store
your code with team-mates on a service like Github.

???

With Github I would recommend keeping everything open, you can always remove things later. If you really, really want to
keep your code private you can either apply for a Github education discount or use Bitbucket.
